EMBER ENGINE CHANGELOG
--------------------------------------
==============
About
==============
The Ember Engine is a custom game engine that I am working on. It's
nothing special and will most likely only be used for my own games, but if
you really want to use it please feel free. Do give credit where credit is
due, however.
If you wish to get in contact with me, please send an email to
( michael.anthony.berger@gmail.com ). I know it's quite lengthy, but I tend
to keep on top of emails unlike other individuals.
